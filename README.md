# 360 Panorama Game Demo

Most games use a standard first-person perspective with a roughly 75-120 degree field of view, mimicking natural human vision. But that means that players don't have information on everything that's not directly in front of them. An alternative approach is to have a full 360 degree horizontal field of view, giving the player complete horizontal spatial awareness. 

The game demo displays both views. The standard 75 degree FOV is displayed on the top, while the full 360 degree FOV is displayed on the bottom.

This is a prototype to determine if the 360 view is interesting. In the future I may create an actual video game using these ideas.
